# AnkiConnect #

The AnkiConnect plugin enables external applications such as [Yomichan for Chrome](https://foosoft.net/projects/yomichan-chrome/) to
communicate with Anki over a remote API. This makes it possible to execute queries against the user's card deck,
automatically create new vocabulary and Kanji flash cards, and more.

## Requirements ##

* [Anki](http://ankisrs.net/) (2.1.x supported)

## Installation (for most users) ##

AnkiConnect can be downloaded from the [shared addon page](https://ankiweb.net/shared/info/2055492159) on AnkiWeb. Once
installed, the extension is ready for immediate use.

### Linux ###
See the `Makefile`

### Windows ###

Windows users may see a firewall nag dialog on Anki startup because this plugins acts as sever. Anki must be unblocked
for this plugin to function.

### Mac OS X ###

Starting with [Mac OS X Mavericks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OS_X_Mavericks), a feature named *App Nap* has been
introduced to the operating system. This feature causes certain applications which are open (but not visible) to be
placed in a suspended state. As this behavior causes AnkiConnect to stop working while you have another window in the
foreground, App Nap should be disabled for Anki:

1.  Start the Terminal application.
2.  Execute the following command in the terminal window:

    ```
    defaults write net.ichi2.anki NSAppSleepDisabled -bool true
    ```
3.  Restart Anki.

## Application Interface (for developers) ##

AnkiConnect exposes Anki features to external applications via an easy to use
[RESTful](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer) API. After it is installed, this plugin will
initialize a minimal HTTP sever running on port 8765 every time Anki executes. Other applications (including browser
extensions) can then communicate with it via HTTP POST requests.

### Sample Invocation ###

Every request consists of an *action*, and a set of contextual *parameters*. A simple example of a JavaScript
application communicating with the extension is illustrated below:

```JavaScript
function ankiInvoke(action, params={}) {
    return new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
        const xhr = new XMLHttpRequest();
        xhr.addEventListener('loadend', () => {
            if (xhr.responseText) {
                resolve(JSON.parse(xhr.responseText));
            } else {
                reject('unable to connect to plugin');
            }
        });

        xhr.open('POST', 'http://127.0.0.1:8765');
        xhr.send(JSON.stringify({action, params}));
    });
}

ankiInvoke('version').then(response => {
    window.alert(`detected API version: ${response}`);
}).catch(error => {
    window.alert(`could not get API version: ${error}`);
});
```

### Supported Actions ###

The following actions are currently supported:

*   `version`

    Gets the version of the API exposed by this plugin. Currently only version `1` is defined.

    This should be the first call you make to make sure that your application and AnkiConnect are able to communicate
    properly with each other. New versions of AnkiConnect will backwards compatible; as long as you are using actions
    which are available in the reported AnkiConnect version or earlier, everything should work fine.

    **Sample request**:
    ```
    {
        action: 'version',
        params: {}
    }
    ```

    **Sample response**:
    ```
    2
    ```
*   `deckNames`

    Gets the complete list of deck names for the current user.

    **Sample request**:
    ```
    {
        action: 'deckNames',
        params: {}
    }
    ```

    **Sample response**:
    ```
    [
        'Default',
        /* ... */
    ]
    ```

*   `modelNames`

    Gets the complete list of model names for the current user.

    **Sample request**:
    ```
    {
        action: 'modelNames',
        params: {}
    }
    ```

    **Sample response**:
    ```
    [
        'Basic',
        'Basic (and reversed card)',
        /* ... */
    ]
    ```

*   `modelFieldNames`

    Gets the complete list of field names for the provided model name.

    **Sample request**:
    ```
    {
        action: 'modelFieldNames',
        params: {
            modelName: 'Basic'
        }
    }
    ```

    **Sample response**:
    ```
    [
        'Front',
        'Back',
        /* ... */
    ]
    ```

*   `addNote`

    Creates a note using the given deck and model, with the provided field values and tags. Returns the identifier of
    the created note created on success, and `null` on failure.

    AnkiConnect can download audio files and embed them in newly created notes. The corresponding *audio* note member is
    optional and can be omitted. If you choose to include it, the *url* and *filename* fields must be also defined. The
    *skipHash* field can be optionally provided to skip the inclusion of downloaded files with an MD5 hash that matches
    the provided value. This is useful for avoiding the saving of error pages and stub files.

    **Sample request**:
    ```
    {
        action: 'addNote',
        params: {
            deckName: 'Default',
            modelName: 'Basic',
            fields: {
                Front: 'front content',
                Back: 'back content',
                /* ... */
            },
            tags: [
                'yomichan',
                /* ... */
            ],
            audio: /* optional */ {
                url: 'https://assets.languagepod101.com/dictionary/japanese/audiomp3.php?kanji=猫&kana=ねこ',
                filename: 'yomichan_ねこ_猫.mp3',
                skipHash: '7e2c2f954ef6051373ba916f000168dc'
            }
        }
    }
    ```

    **Sample response**:
    ```
    null
    ```

*   `addNotes`

    Creates multiple notes using the given deck and model, with the provided field values and tags. Returns an array of
    identifiers of the created notes (notes that could not be created will have a `null` identifier). Please see the
    documentation for `addNote` for an explanation of objects in the `notes` array.

    **Sample request**:
    ```
    {
        action: 'addNotes',
        params: {
            notes: [

                        /* ... */
                    ],

        null,
        /* ... */
    ]
    ```

*   `canAddNotes`

    Accepts an array of objects which define parameters for candidate notes (see `addNote`) and returns an array of
    booleans indicating whether or not the parameters at the corresponding index could be used to create a new note.

    ```
    {
        action: 'canAddNotes',
        params: {
            notes: [

    GitHub. Returns a boolean value indicating if the plugin was upgraded or not.
